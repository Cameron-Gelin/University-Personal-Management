# University-Personal-Management
This is a class project I completed for my Object Oriented Class.
It takes the information of 2 students, 1 faculty member, and a staff member.
After inputting the students' name, student ID number, GPA, and amount of credit hours, it will generate a tuition invoice of each student depending on their GPA and amount of credits enrolled in.
It takes similar information for the faculty member but limits the Rank to either Professor or Adjunct ONLY. Same thing for staff, department must either be Mathematics, Engineering, or English.
